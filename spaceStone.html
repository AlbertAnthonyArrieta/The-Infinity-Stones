          Befitting its name, the Space Stone held dominion over the fabric of space being able to teleport its users anywhere in the universe. The Space Stone at some point in time was housed in a cubic containment device, which came to be known as the Tesseract. It’s first appearance was in Captain America: The First Avenger where it was used by Red Skull to power his military weapons in WW2. The stone had a long journey in the MCU, it was in possession by S.H.I.E.L.D. right after the events of Captain America, played a key part in the first Avengers during Loki’s invasion, and was stored in Odin’s vault for a long period of time until Loki takes it again in Thor: Ragnarok. In Avengers: Infinity War, the space stone was the first stone collected by Thanos in the movie (having the power stone already possessed off screen).
