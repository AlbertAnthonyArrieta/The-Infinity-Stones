          The Soul Stone represented the soul. It would later go on to cultivate a reputation of mystery throughout the galaxy. Even those who were well versed in the powers, and even locations, of the other five stones, had little concrete knowledge regarding the Soul Stone to the point of only knowing its name. Despite, or perhaps because of, this aura of mystery, it would eventually be considered as the most dangerous of all the Infinity Stones. The first ever appearance of the stone was in Avengers: Infinity War where it was on the planet Vormir being guarded by Red Skull who was assumed to be transported there by the Tesseract (Space Stone) back in Captain America: The First Avenger. In order to obtain the Soul Stoneâ€™s power, one must sacrifice a loved one. In the movie, Thanos sacrificed his daughter Gamora in order to take the stone.
