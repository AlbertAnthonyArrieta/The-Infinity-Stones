          The mind stone is the master of minds. It is mostly recognized by many as the yellow gem on Vision’s forehead. However it did not reside on his forehead not until Avengers: Age of Ultron where the stone gave life to Vision. The stone first appeared on Loki’s scepter which was assumed to be lent from Thanos to lead the Chitauri army during the Battle of New York. Loki used it to control minds when he first invaded earth but was later defeated, giving it to the hands of the Avengers. The scepter was later stolen by hydra which was then used by Ultron in Avengers: Age of Ultron in hopes of creating a powerful humanoid body that he could live in but instead lead to the birth of Vision. Vision remained as the sole owner of the stone until Thanos rips it off his corpse in Avengers: Infinity War.
